PhishScan,"Robust and convenient web-based tool to identify phishing emails, and suspicious URL blacklisting","Python, Flask, Machine Learning","The web tool processes email subjects, content, and any embedded URLs by evaluating them against a model trained with the Naïve Bayes algorithm. During the model training phase, the dataset was found to be noisy and imbalanced, requiring extensive cleaning and preprocessing. This involved tokenizing keywords and identifying suspicious terms from a predefined list of commonly flagged keywords. To address the class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, generating synthetic samples for the underrepresented class. Before finalizing the Naïve Bayes model, the dataset was also trained using the Random Forest algorithm. After comparing the accuracy and precision of both models, Naïve Bayes proved to be more effective in classifying the data.

Naïve Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that assumes features are independent given the class. It’s simple, fast, and works well for text classification or small datasets, but it can perform poorly if the feature independence assumption is violated.

Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that does not assume feature independence. It’s more flexible and powerful for complex tasks, can handle non-linear relationships, and is less sensitive to correlations between features. However, it’s more computationally expensive and harder to interpret.

In short, Naïve Bayes is quick and effective for simpler problems with independent features, while Random Forest is better suited for complex, high-dimensional data with non-linear relationships."

[CONFIDENTIAL] Digital TransformationHospital Project,"Transform the manual and repetitive process of using a physical item that will be used frequently and daily, into an application on an ipad","React, Browser storage, iPad, Browser translation API","Gathered and analyzed stakeholder requirements to define the features and functionality of the project. Based on the requirements, designed a high-level Figma prototype and iterated on it through continuous stakeholder feedback.

Developed a React-based web application that integrates IndexedDB and local storage, optimizing it for both iPad touch and keyboard inputs. This development helped streamline processes, enhancing user efficiency and reducing human effort and errors by 80%, resulting in significant operational improvements.

Throughout the project, I collaborated within Agile sprints, ensuring regular stakeholder reviews and daily stand-up meetings to ensure continuous progress and alignment with the project’s goals.",confidential.jpg,,
Live2You,"Language learning application to facilitate language learning through interactive and engaging efforts with everyday objects. Reducing cognitive load, as well the ease of identifying and learning about their environment. Aims to bridge gaps between recognition and comprehension for a new language. ","Kotlin, Jetpack-compose, Android device, AR, Google MLKit Translation API, SpeechRecognizer API, Firestore, Firebase","The system utilizes interactive learning through object detection with augmented reality (AR) overlays. It translates detected objects using a translation API integrated with Google MLKit. Additionally, learners can save and view the objects they have detected, with this data being stored in Google Firestore Firebase. The tool also includes a pronunciation and practice feature using the SpeechRecognizer API, allowing learners to practice pronunciation for better retention.",live2you.png,https://youtu.be/22NLYOyA2XE?si=Pey0Tic7ZbajZQNg,
[CONFIDENTIAL] System research and experiment testing,Research project to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a medical device as a new method for a medical screening that has been identified as increasing in Singapore. ,"Raspberry Pi, VNC client, React, Python, Flask, CITI Social & Beehavioral Responsible Conduct of Research Certificate","Conducted initial research on medical illnesses and gathered feedback on existing solutions. Designed and executed experiments to test the usability and effectiveness of the system. During the process,  controlled variables were identified and the experiment  was structured with fixed parameters to ensure consistency. Feedback was collected and analyzed to inform further improvements.

In the next phase, the old system was migrated including the enhancement of the user interface, transitioning the system from a local desktop application to a web app running on Raspberry Pi. To improve usability, instructional videos and text instructions were added. As well as a testing feature, allowing users to trial a part of the system before committing to the full screening procedure.

Data from each screening was stored locally in the user's browser using local storage, ensuring accessibility and privacy. Lastly, there is an addition of a results page that generates a QR code, enabling users to scan and save their results for future reference.",confidential.jpg,,
Digital Transformation Automated Project,"Transform a manual, repetitive process into a comprehensive, automated system, significantly streamlining data management and updates. Reducing the time and effort required for data handling as well as improved accuracy and consistency, allowing for more efficient and reliable updates.","HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Oracle DB, UiPath, C#","Led the development of a multi-application data automation project, resulting in a minimum of 15% improvement in user efficiency. Designed a responsive web interface that consolidated all required data fields in a single, easy-to-use page, eliminating the need for users to navigate through multiple pages and sections. Upon user confirmation and submission, the interface seamlessly triggers an automated data updating process, where a cloud bot powered by UiPath is launched. The bot then accesses the legacy system and automatically inputs the updated data, streamlining the entire process and minimizing user effort.",automation.jpg,,
ShopeeMall - Shopee Product & Design Challenge 2022,Improving the reliability and confidence of users in an interactive way while addressing their doubts or uncertainties particularly with using ShopeeMall.,Figma,"Gathered user feedback on their experiences with ShopeeMall, analyzed the data, and created a user journey map to identify key touchpoints. From this, we focused on two main objectives: enhancing the product experience and providing a reliable method to verify product authenticity.

Dsigned several prototype features, including the MallAR Filter, which lets users virtually try on clothing and visualize furniture in their environment through AR. This feature offers flexibility by allowing users to upload an image or use a live camera view for a more immersive experience. 

We also introduced a Product Measurements display, making it easier for users to assess how products, especially clothing and furniture, will fit into their lives.

Lastly, the **Authenticator Feature** enables users to verify the authenticity of their purchases by entering a product code or scanning the QR code on the item, enhancing confidence in their shopping decisions.",shopeechallenge.png,,
